Relevant information

Most of the already existing speech recognition systems are global
systems (typically Hidden Markov Models and Time Delay Neural Networks)
which recognises signals and do not really use the speech
specificities.  On the contrary, analytical systems take into account
the articulatory process leading to the different phonemes of a given
language, the idea being to deduce  the presence of each of the
phonetic features from the acoustic observation.


Attribute info:
This database contains vowels coming from 1809 isolated syllables (for
example: pa, ta, pan,...).  Five different attributes were chosen to
characterize each vowel: they are the amplitudes of the five first
harmonics AHi, normalised by the total energy Ene (integrated on all the
frequencies): AHi/Ene. Each harmonic is signed: positive when it
corresponds to a local maximum of the spectrum and negative otherwise.

Target:
The aim of the present database is to distinguish between nasal and
oral vowels. There are thus two different classes:

	Class 0 : Nasals
	Class 1 : Orals
